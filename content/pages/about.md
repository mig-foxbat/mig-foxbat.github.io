Astronomy, Paleatology, Theoretical Physics are my favourite subjects in Science. But I have very minimal indulgence these days with Science. My favourite scientist was Carl Sagan. He impressed not only as a scientist but as a Human with this stand on importance Science in society and Nuclear disarmament. His book [Cosmos](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345539435/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1430742007&sr=8-2&keywords=cosmos) has a great impact on my life.
